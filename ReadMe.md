# Financial Management System

This is a financial management platform designed to help students track their expenses, manage their budget, set financial goals, and create fundraising campaigns. The platform also includes a donation feature that allows donors to contribute to a student's campaign.

The actors in this platform are the student and the donor. The preconditions are that the student has access to the internet and a device to use the platform, has registered and logged in to their account, and has provided necessary personal and financial information for setting up a profile and using the platform's features. The postconditions are that the student has successfully tracked their expenses and income, managed their budget, set financial goals, and/or created a fundraising campaign, while the donor has successfully donated funds to a student's campaign.

Overall, this platform provides a simple and convenient solution for financial management for students, while also providing an opportunity for donors to contribute to a student's educational expenses.
